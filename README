Detailed command doc

gorf changes
- List all the backed up changes that gorf has made in the past,
where the one indexed by zero is the most recent.

gorf clear
- Remove all gorf backups. Undos will not be possible after
performing this action.

gorf move <old path> <new path> [<name>+]
- Move the package in the old path to the new path. If one or
more names are specified, only the objects named will be moved
to the new path, if possible (if it is not possible, nothing
happens). Moving a type also moves methods with that type as
its receiver.

gorf moveall
- Move everything in the old path, including nested packages,
to the corresponding place in the new path.

gorf merge <old path> <new path>
- Merge the contents of the package in the old path into the new
path.

gorf pkg <path> <new name>
- Rename a package (without changing its import path).

gorf rename <path> [<type>.]<old name> <new name>
- Rename an object in the package specified. If the old name
is prefixed by a type, for instance "gorf rename path T.X Y",
the X field in type T will be renamed to Y.

gorf scan <path>
- Print out a representation of the ast for this package.

gorf undo
- Undoes the change indexed by 0 in gorf changes, and decrements
the index for all other changes.
