gorf package "package path" newname
gorf mvtarget "oldpath" "newpath"
gorf mvglobal "package path" oldname newname  
gorf mvfield "package path" typename oldfield newfield

gorf will consider all source visible in subdirectories from the CWD to
be fair game.

If a particular global or type is defined in multiple source files, gorf
will act on all of them individually, trusting the builder to know to not
compile them together.
