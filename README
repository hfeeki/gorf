DO NOT RUN THIS ON IMPORTANT CODE

IT WILL REWRITE YOUR CODE WITH NO GUARANTEE OF CORRECTNESS

Usage: gorf <command>

commands:
 target <old target> <new target>
 package <target> <old name> <new name>
 func <target> <package> <old name> <new name>
 var <target> <package> <old name> <new name>
 const <target> <package> <old name> <new name>
 type <target> <package> <old name> <new name>
 //field <target> <package> <type> <old name> <new name>
 undo

A target is the import path. Targets and relative paths to package
directories need to match.

Relative paths are not noticed (yet)

gorf will consider all source visible in subdirectories from the CWD to
be fair game.

If a particular global or type is defined in multiple source files, gorf
will act on all of them individually, trusting the builder to know to not
compile them together.
